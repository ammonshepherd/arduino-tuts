# Arduino and Processing

Many of the tutorials out there have lots of unnecessary code and don't explain
the basics of connecting the Arduino to Processing very well. This tutorial
hopes to make it super simple.


## Arduino to Processing
This tutorial has the very basic code needed to send data from Arduino to
Processing.

- [Arduino to Processing](arduino-to-processing.md)

And a slightly more involved example of sending data from Arduino to
Processing.

- [Arduino to Processing with Photoresistor](arduino-to-processing-photoresistor.md)

## Processing to Arduino
This tutorial also has the very basic code needed to send data from Processing to
Arduino.

- [Processing to Arduino](processing-to-arduino.md)

And a slightly more involved example of sending from Processing to Arduino.

- [Processing to Arduino with 5 LEDs](processing-to-arudino-5-leds.md)
