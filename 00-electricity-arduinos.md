  1. Verify: Compiles and approves your code. It will catch errors in syntax (like missing semi-colons or parenthesis).
  1. Upload: Sends your code to the RedBoard. When you click it, you should see the lights on your board blink rapidly.
  1. New: This buttons opens up a new code window tab.
  1. Open: This button will let you open up an existing sketch.
  1. Save: This saves the currently active sketch.
  1. Serial Monitor: This will open a window that displays any serial information your RedBoard is transmitting. It is very useful for debugging.
  1. Sketch Name: This shows the name of the sketch you are currently working on.
  1. Code Area: This is the area where you compose the code for your sketch.
  1. Message Area: This is where the IDE tells you if there were any errors in your code.
  1. Text Console: The text console shows complete error messages. When debugging, the text console is very useful.
  1. Board and Serial Port: Shows you what board and the serial port selections
